Perfect 👍
I’ll **finalize the README for your actual repository** and fix the small things (real repo link, clearer steps).
You can **copy-paste this directly into your `README.md`** on GitHub.

# 🚗 PlotSense – IoT-Based Smart Parking System

PlotSense is an **IoT-based smart parking prototype** designed to solve parking management issues in malls and public spaces. It uses **IR sensors with ESP32** to detect parking slot occupancy and sends real-time data to **Supabase**, which is visualized on a **React-based dashboard with authentication**.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **ESP32**
* **IR Sensors**
* **Supabase** (Database + Authentication)
* **React.js** (Frontend Dashboard)
* **Node.js / npm**

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oswinmenezes/PlotSense.git
cd PlotSense
```

---

## 🔌 ESP32 Setup

### 2️⃣ Upload Code to ESP32

* Open the **`smartParking`** file in **Arduino IDE**
* Select the correct **ESP32 board** and **COM port**

---

### 3️⃣ Update Credentials in ESP32 Code

Before uploading, update the following inside the `smartParking` file:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

const char* supabaseUrl = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
const char* supabaseKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";
```

📌 **Make sure:**

* IR sensors are connected to the correct ESP32 GPIO pins
* WiFi credentials are correct
* Supabase project is already created

---

### 4️⃣ Upload the Code

* Click **Upload** in Arduino IDE
* Open **Serial Monitor** to confirm ESP32 is connected and sending data

---

## 🗄️ Supabase Setup

### 5️⃣ Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to the **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the following:

   * **Project URL**
   * **Anon Public Key**

---

## 🖥️ Frontend (React Dashboard) Setup

### 6️⃣ Add Supabase Credentials

Open **`src/supabaseClient.js`** and update:

```javascript
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabaseUrl = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
const supabaseAnonKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

---

### 7️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 8️⃣ Run the Project Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

(or the port shown in your terminal)

---

## 🔐 Features

* Real-time parking slot detection
* Secure authentication using Supabase
* Live React-based dashboard
* Cloud-based real-time data sync
* Scalable architecture for public parking spaces
